🔍 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

🚀 Project Highlight
I recently worked on a customer segmentation project using the popular Shopping Mall Customer Dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to categorize customers into distinct groups based on two key variables:

    Annual Income

    Spending Score

I implemented K-Means Clustering to segment the customers into optimal clusters. This visualization clearly reflects how customer behaviors can be grouped for better marketing strategies.

📊 Tools Used:
Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn
💡 Key Insights from the Graph

From the scatter plot:

    5 Distinct Customer Segments emerged:

        🟦 High Spenders with Low Income (Blue): This group spends heavily despite a lower income, possibly indicating aspirational or impulsive buyers.

        🟥 High Income, High Spenders (Red): Premium customers – ideal for luxury marketing campaigns.

        🟨 High Income, Low Spenders (Yellow): Price-conscious affluent customers – might respond well to value-based offerings.

        🟪 Low Income, Low Spenders (Purple): Budget-conscious group – potentially untapped or low-priority.

        🟩 Moderate Income, Moderate Spenders (Green): Stable and consistent customers – good for loyalty programs.

    The cyan dots represent the centroids of each cluster – the average behavior of each segment.

    The plot shows clear separability among most groups, which indicates well-defined customer behavior patterns based on income and spending.

🤖 Why it matters:

This project underscores how machine learning can drive data-driven decisions in marketing and CRM. By identifying customer segments, businesses can:

    Personalize campaigns 🎯

    Improve retention strategies 🔁

    Maximize ROI 💰
